# Food Truck Project

## Description
This project was a competition of food trucks based on the users input. The user would type the food truck name, food type, and the rating of that food truck. After the user was done inputing all of the information, a new menu would come up asking if the user would like to see a display of all the food trucks that were input with all of their properties, the average score, and the highest scoring truck.

## Lesson Learned
This was a difficult project to start. I am still having difficulties with arrays and objects. I have a little better understanding of it, but I still have a long way to go.

## Technologies Used
eclipse, slack, github
